# gym-companion

This project is a mobile app developed for android that aims to provide a number of convienence features 
for tracking progress at the gym.

The app should have the following functionality:
  -- set up a workout schedule
    -- add new exercises 
    -- select a time frame for the schedule (ie, 2 weeks)
    -- add exercises to any day in the schedule, with reps and sets
    -- can edit schedule at any time
  -- follow the schedule
    -- input weight and reps/sets (if failed)
    -- show whether each exercise passed or failed
    -- allow for notes on each exercise
    -- meter for how difficult the exercise was (maybe -- sometimes this would not help much)
    -- option for notifications when the schedule says to go to the gym (low priority)
  -- infographics
    -- graphs showing progress: weight (sort by specific exercise, eg, heavy squats only or volume squats only)
